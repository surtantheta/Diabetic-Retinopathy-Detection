# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
We aim to create an automated analysis system capable of classifying each retinal image to one of the classes (normal, mild, moderate, severe and proliferative), corresponding to the severity of the disease.
A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:
<ul>
  <li> 0 - No DR </li>
  <li> 1 - Mild </li>
  <li> 2 - Moderate </li>
  <li> 3 - Severe </li>
  <li> 4 - Proliferative DR </li>
 </ul>
